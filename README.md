# Image-classification-using-transfer-learning-a-Inception-net-and-Resnet
- CIFAR10 dataset was used for Image classification.
- The network architecture takes the pretrained model (GoogLe Net and ResNet). 
- Training was done in three different approach:
  1. Taking the architecture without the weights and do training from scratch.
  2. Taking the architecture along with the weights and perform end-end fine tuning.
  3. Taking the architecture along with the weights and fine tuning only the last layer.
